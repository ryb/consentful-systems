                <p> <i>This is a project website of "Yes: Affirmative Consent as a Theoretical Framework for Understanding and Imagining Social Platforms", a paper accepted to <a href="http://chi2021.acm.org/">CHI 2021</a>, a top-tier conference in Human-Computer Interaction.

                <p> <b>How can we design a social internet where people's consent boundaries are protected?</b> Non-consensual interactions are pervasive in online spaces, such as online harassment and revenge porn.
                In this work, we use a theoretical framework of <strong>affirmative consent ("Yes means yes!")</strong> to understand such problematic phenomena and generate new design ideas to tackle them.
                This website highlights the 1) principles of affirmative consent and 2) the design insights generated from the principles for building consentful platforms. </p>

                We first introduce the five principles of affirmative consent. If you are curious about the prior research that has informed these principles, please check our <a href="" style="color: white"><b>paper</b></a>!

                <div class="header"> 4) Affirmative consent is <strong>specific</strong>. </div>
                People should be able to consent to a particular action (or a particular person), and not a series of actions or people.

                    In this section, we first describe the sociotechnical building blocks generated by the principles above, and then introduce the concrete interaction features grounded on the building blocks. If you click the building blocks, the corresponding features will be highlighted in the table.
